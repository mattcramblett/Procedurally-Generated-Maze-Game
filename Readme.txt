Lab 2 Readme
Matt Cramblett & Matias Grotewold

You MUST press space to generate a maze before doing anything else. If you don't do this first, things will break.
Also, you must only press space once per running of the game.

Move the player model with WASD. Rotate the player model with Q and E. In spite of the model rotating, it will always move in a direction relative to the other side of the maze. 

Rotate the scene with 0.
